# Sort Functions

Three rudimentary sort functions implemented in Python that were based off of the book [Intorduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).

* Insertion Sort : Same as the book's version including a comparison counter
* Merge Sort : Same as the book's version
* Heap Sort : Same as the book's version
