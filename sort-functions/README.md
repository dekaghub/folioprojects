# Sort Functions
All the three sort functions use a global counter variabe to count the number of comparisons. The execution time is calculated in nanoseconds. The datasets used were generated with the genDataset.py provided program.

The three python programs of the sort functions write to a file labelled as output_SortName.txt. The output files are formatted as InputSize \t ComparisonCount \t ExecutionTimeInNanoSeconds.



## Insertion Sort
The insertion sort is a a slightly modified version of the book's insertion sort.
To execute, use python InsertionSort.py

## Merge Sort
The merge sort is the book's version implemented in python.
To execute, use python MergeSort.py

## Heap Sort
The heap sort is the book's version implemented in python.
To execute, use python HeapSort.py

# Files in the project directory

20 Datasets sequentially named as datafile1 - datafile20.

## Execution
Python 3.7.3 was used to make the programs.

To run any other datasets in any of the sort programs the dataset would have to be numbered.


1. Change the title variable to the name of the file
2. Change the range in the for loop respectively to avoid errors
3. Change/Check the output file to view the results
